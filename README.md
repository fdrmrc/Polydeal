***PolyDEAL*** is an open source project in C++ which aims to provide building blocks for the implementation of Polygonal Discontinuous Galerkin methods, within the Finite Element library [**deal.II**](https://dealii.org).


## Getting started
Assuming deal.II (version 9.5 onwards) is installed on your machine, all is required to do is:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fdrmrc/Polydeal.git
cd Polydeal/
mkdir build
cd build/
make -j<N>
```
